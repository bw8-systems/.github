# `bw8`
A homebrew 8-bit ISA with reference implementations and custom tooling.

## Instruction Set
The uniting element of all projects in this organization is the bw8 instruction set. This is a custom 8-bit ISA which was developed with ease of use-by-humans in mind. This goal is juxtaposed against the reality of the set using 8-bit opcodes - there's very little space to provide rich addressing modes and spacious register sets. As such, bw8 has an eccentric but undeniably unique personality. After sufficient umming and ahhing over instruction inclusion, its effectively found balance in the stated design goals. With a stable instruction set in hand, this GitHub organization emerges as a collection of projects implementing the set in one way or the other.
